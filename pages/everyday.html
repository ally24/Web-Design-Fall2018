	Most people don't think about the beautiful design of their iphone on a day-to-day basis. Not only is it functionally deisgned well--being thin, pocket-sized, and easy to navigate--but it also is aesthetically designed well. It comes in a couple simple colors that help enhance the modern maturity of the phone. There is only a small apple symbol on the back of the phone to clearly represent the brand. If customers choose to, they can add a colorful case to liven up the phone, but the phone itself beautifully represents the chic, modern vibe of the company.
